            Family-based petitions include those filed by U.S. citizens and permanent residents on behalf of their immediate relatives (e.g., spouses, parents, siblings, and children). If your immediate relative is a U.S. citizen, then you may be eligible to adjust your status in the United States. Once the paperwork is filed, you can immediately qualify for a work permit and travel permit. The work permit will allow you to obtain a social security card and a California I.D. or Driver’s License. The green card is usually given to you after your interview at the local immigration office. Please call for current processing times.

From the beginning he made us feel so confident that my hubby will get a green card and indeed he did! We literally talked to multiple lawyers in San Jose and San Francisco and they all said his case was too complex. Richard made it seem so easy! I love you Richard!! Oh and Richard is a good looking lawyer too. Lol double plus!"</p>

        I've hired other "lawyers", and one took my payment and left the country! Other one was real state attorney who was doing "immigration"! Those never finished work, and I was very skeptical when it comes to hiring a great immigration attorney.
        Richard changed my perspective by actually getting things done in 3 months!! He's very much like cut to the chase lawyer who helped me sort out my complicated situation. I am very thankful and only to wish him keep doing more fabulous work! :)
