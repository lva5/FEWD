The work permit will allow you to obtain a social security card and a California I.D. or Driver’s License. The green card is usually given to you after your interview at the local immigration office.

      <p class="mb-0">"Richard is hands down the best immigration lawyer!! Today we had our interview and Richard came all the way down to San Jose to be there with us. From the beginning he made us feel so confident that my hubby will get a green card and indeed he did! We literally talked to multiple lawyers in San Jose and San Francisco and they all said his case was too complex. Richard made it seem so easy! I love you Richard!! Oh and Richard is a good looking lawyer too. Lol double plus!"</p>

      <p class="mb-0">"SUPER IMMIGRATION LAWYER!!
        I've hired other "lawyers", and one took my payment and left the country! Other one was real state attorney who was doing "immigration"! Those never finished work, and I was very skeptical when it comes to hiring a great immigration attorney.
        Richard changed my perspective by actually getting things done in 3 months!! He's very much like cut to the chase lawyer who helped me sort out my complicated situation. I am very thankful and only to wish him keep doing more fabulous work! :)
        If you are looking for an absolutely amazing immigration attorney, Richard is the GO TO lawyer! :)"</p>
